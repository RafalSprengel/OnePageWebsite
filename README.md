## General Info
A single page website is one that fits on a single page. Single page websites are fully loaded in the initial page load, making the experience more continuous and fluid for the user.
Single page websites became a trend recently, mostly among designer sites because this type of web design is perfect for a portfolio. But it can also be found in apps or product sites, basically anything that is not heavy on content. Showcasing all the content of a website in a single page is a great way to save time for visitors as they won't have to jump from one page to another and the site only has to load once.
